/// Wall-clock scheduler for the automatic day digest. Same minute-tick design
/// as `DailyMemoryExportScheduler` (correct across sleep/wake and DST), with
/// two digest-specific twists:
///
/// - the durable marker is the journal file's modification time:
///   written at/after today's scheduled hour means done (survives relaunch,
///   and a manual regenerate after the hour counts too), while a digest the
///   user generated in the morning is refreshed at the scheduled hour with
///   the fuller day;
/// - past days are finalized once after the local date changes, oldest first
///   and at most `catchUpDays` back. Rewriting a journal after its day ended
///   makes the mtime a durable finalization marker, so late work after the
///   evening preview is included without an extra database flag;
/// - a day with nothing to digest yet is not a failure — the generate closure
///   reports it and the scheduler simply retries on a later tick, so a
///   meeting that ends at 19:00 still gets digested the same evening.
